# Dear Visitor,
on these pages you can find some of my work past and present which I found worthy to be published.

I am always happy to know if somebody finds my work useful or can profit from my previous efforts. I am equally thankful about any comment on the stuff you find here. You can contact me via email to elyahu.de @ gmail.com. 

I am always looking for interesting projects and offers. Take a look at my my GitHub profile and at my LinkedIn and XING. A formal CV is available upon request.

This homepage serves as a link center to my Open Source projects and other publications. 

Like my work? Let me know.
