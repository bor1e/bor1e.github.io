This is basically a routine job, once you finish the local development and test, you want to see your application live on a server. This in turn means, you have to create a LAMP or a MEAN or similar ready-to-go server, i.e. a server which has all the used services and libs installed. If this is something you face often you should take a look on ansible, which allows a pretty fast and save way to create a ready to deploy server.   Use Case  Since, I often use databases and webframeworks, I decided to automate the process of deployment, to be able to primarly focus on creating webapplications and focusing less on server initialization.
