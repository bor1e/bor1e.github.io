This is basically a routine job, once you finish the local development and test, you want to see your application live on a server. This in turn means, you have to create a [LAMP] or a [MEAN] or similar ready-to-go server, i.e. a server which has all the used services and libs installed. If this is something you face often you should take a look on ansible, which allows a pretty fast and save way to create a ready to deploy server.   Challenge | Use Case  Since, I often use databases and webframeworks, I decided to automate the process of deployment, to be able to primarly focus on creating webapplications and focusing less on server initialization.  Goal::     pass the host-IP and CNAME   perform some ansible-magic   visit the CNAME server, find the application  running without presonally ssh-ing the server!   Solution  Ansible performs automation and orchestration of IT environments by accessing the server via SSH and running YAML Playbooks. So what services and libs should be preinstalled on the server for my appliaction to run?   Requirements  In my case the following is a list of required libs/services:     python3, python3-dev, python3-pip   python-virtualenv, rabbitmq-server   nginx   postgresql, postgresql-contrib, postgresql-server-dev-all, python-psycopg2, python3-dev, build-essential, libpq-dev   user   As you probably noticed, I categorized them already, first two are framework related-libs, third is a webserver, than a DB and finally a user, who will be responsible for deploying.   Roles  // TODO   Lessons-Learned     Use seperate playbooks for initializing a server and a deployment (on an initialized webserver)   References  ","categories": ["DevOps"],
